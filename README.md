# FPShooter
This is the beginning of a first person shooter game that I was messing around with. Currently I have no plan for what I want to do with it specifically, but I just wanted to get the basics finished. 
  
You can shoot at the enemies and kill them. The guns use raycasting for their bullets and for the AR and Sniper you can zoom up with them, and they will have a scope.  
  
The enemies use Unity's pathfinding AI to determine where they can go. This makes it so they will go around walls correctly and will be able to follow the player in areas they can reach.
